Method overloading in C is not a feature directly supported by the C programming language since it lacks the object-oriented features found in languages like C++. However, you can achieve method overloading in C by using different function names or by varying the number and types of parameters in your functions.

Here's an example of method overloading in C using different function names:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add_integers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

float add_floats(float x, float y) {
    return x + y;
}

int main() {
    int result1 = add_integers(5, 3);
    float result2 = add_floats(2.5, 3.2);

    printf("Result of integer addition: %d\n", result1);
    printf("Result of float addition: %.2f\n", result2);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have two functions: `add_integers` and `add_floats`, each of which takes different types of parameters. The functions have different names but provide similar functionality, simulating method overloading.

If you want to achieve overloading with the same function name but different parameter types or numbers, you can use variadic functions and inspect the arguments at runtime to decide which operation to perform.

Here's an example of simulating method overloading with a single function name using variadic arguments:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

int add(int num_args, ...) {
    int sum = 0;
    va_list args;
    va_start(args, num_args);

    for (int i = 0; i < num_args; i++) {
        int arg = va_arg(args, int);
        sum += arg;
    }

    va_end(args);
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    int result1 = add(2, 5, 3);
    int result2 = add(3, 2, 4, 6);

    printf("Result of integer addition (2 arguments): %d\n", result1);
    printf("Result of integer addition (3 arguments): %d\n", result2);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use a single `add` function that accepts a variable number of integer arguments. The number of arguments is determined at runtime, and the function calculates the sum. This simulates method overloading with the same function name but different argument counts.

Remember that these are workarounds in C, and in languages like C++, method overloading is a built-in feature, providing a more elegant and structured way to achieve the same functionality.
